Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude

To fulfill the first requirement, I used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, I created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

  * Latitude vs. Temperature

  * Latitude vs. Humidity

  * Latitude vs. Cloudiness

  * Latitude vs. Wind Speed
  
Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

To fulfill the second requirement, I computed the linear regression for each relationship. Separated the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). 

Next, I created a series of scatter plots. I was sure to include the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r values as you can see in the following image

I created the following plots:

  * Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

  * Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

  * Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

  * Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

  * Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

  * Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

  * Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

  * Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots, I explained what the linear regression is modeling.
